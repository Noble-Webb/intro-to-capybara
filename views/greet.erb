<h1>Hi <%= params[:user_name] %>, nice to meet you!</h1>

# If you are unfamiliar with the params object and how it relates to form and inputs, 
# that's totally fine. The TL;DR is that all the information the user submitted in the
# form is available to your code within a hash named params. params[:user_name] returns
# the text the user typed into the form input field user_name. <%= params[:user_name] %> 
# uses ERB's embedded ruby to dynamically insert the value of params[:user_name]
